Authentication is defined as the act of proving something or someone to be valid/genuine. The core purpose of authentication is to grant authorized individuals access to a system or resource only. This is an important process that secures your personal information and makes it accessible to you only. In the modern digital world, unauthorized access to information introduces hackers, scammers, and other malicious actors who can impersonate you. The most common and traditional form of authentication is passwords, such as entering your password to unlock your phone. Biometrics is another form of authentication; it is the use of unique biological traits such as fingerprints and facial recognition. There is also MFA, Multi-factor authentication. It is a layered approach that combines two or more different methods to enhance security, which is now becoming widely encouraged. It's as simple as logging into your email from an unrecognized device and having to enter a pin sent to your main device to complete the login process.
